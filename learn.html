        <h4 class="title">Intro:</h4>
        <p>I grew up just South of Denver in an average suburban
          neighborhood. I spent my younger years trying to learn everything I
          could. Whether I was trying to learn trigonometry so I could calculate
          how high my model rockets were flying, or trying to learn some new
          skill like yo-yoing, I always wanted to be doing something new and
          exciting. The desire to try new things carried over into my work life,
          so I have worked in many different fields. I have
          done landscaping, house remodeling, audio engineering, shipping
          management, housekeeping, and have even taken care of chickens for
          a few months. </p>
          <h4 class="title">Hobbies:</h4>
            <img class = "body" src="assets/images/band.jpg" alt="assets/images/frown.jpg">
          <p>I have an insatiable love for the outdoors. Whether I'm up in the
            mountains climbing or backpacking or, I'm out cycling, being outside
            is very important to me. Music has also been a big part of my
            life. My parents started me on piano when I was 4 years old and I
            continued with classical lessons for the next 8 years. I really
            love piano but when I got a bit older I decided I wanted to
            learn a "cooler" instrument. I know most people would immediately
            think guitar when someone says they moved to a "cooler" instrument,
            but in elementary school I decided on violin and trumpet. Taking two
            music lessons a week ended up being too much for an elementary
            school kid so I went back to just piano lessons. Through
            high school I dabbled in bass, guitar, and mandolin, played in a
            successful band for a while, and wound up interning at a
            recording studio.</p>
            <h4 class="title">Family:</h4>
            <p>My parents, Cheryl and Steve, are both very supportive and caring
              people. Even though we have had our differences, I know that I am
              both who I am and where I am because of what they have pushed me to do
              and the opportunities they have given me. My dad is an
              environmental lawyer who deals primarily with water law and my mom
              takes care of the house and works with horses. I am an only child
              but our family had two dogs, Pint and Graden, who definitely felt
              like siblings at times.</p>
            <h4 class="title">Friends:</h4>
            <p>I have had a lot of friends come in and out of my life over the
                past few years, including my close friend Ashton who was my
                climbing partner for a few years. I am still in contact with all
                my friends from when I was in high school but we have all gone
                down separate paths and do not see each other very often. That
                being said, I feel like I have a great group of very supportive
                friends.</p>
              <h4 class = "title">Conclusion:</h4>
              <p>I have tried a lot of things and have had a wide variety
                of experiences over my lifetime. I really look forward to
                seeing what comes next!</p>
