    <p>I am very excited for the opportunities that Galvanize can provide for
      me. I have always enjoyed both building things and math and I feel like
      programming is a great combination of the two. After working in many
      different industries Iâ€™m really looking forward to taking this next step
      towards a more professional work environment and I hope to be involved in
      some unique and exciting projects in the future!</p>
